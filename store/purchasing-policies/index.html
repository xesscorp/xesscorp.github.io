<h2><a name="Are the XS Boards only suitable for simple logic designs">Are the 
XS Boards only suitable for simple logic designs?</a></h2>
<p>No!&nbsp; Our<span lang="en-us"> <a href="/prods/prod035.php">XSA-3S1000 Board</a> 
contains a Spartan3 FPGA with 1,000,000 gates of logic and a 32 MByte SDRAM.&nbsp; 
Even our smallest </span><a href="/prods/prod047.php">XuLA-50 Board</a> 
<span lang="en-us">has</span> a 50,000-gate Spartan3A FPGA and 
8 MB of SDRAM.&nbsp; These FPGAs have <span lang="en-us">more than </span>enough room to hold a complete microcontroller 
core along with custom application circuitry.&nbsp; Take a look at the <a href="/design_examples.php">design 
examples</a> from XESS and our customers to get an idea of the complexity of designs 
supported by these boards.</p>
<p>The XSA Boards can also be inserted into our <a href="/prods/prod042.php">XSTend 
Board</a> to provide additional LEDs, buttons, SRAM, RS232 port, and stereo 
and video codecs for processing multimedia signals.&nbsp; A prototyping area lets you connect 
external circuitry to the XSA Board.</p>
<p>For designs that require advanced audio and video processing along 
with networking capabilities, our <a href="/prods/prod032.php">XSB-300E</a> Board 
is a perfect match!&nbsp; It uses the SpartanIIE FPGA with 300,000 system gates 
and has multi-channel audio and video codecs along with a 10/100 Ethernet interface.</p>

<h2><a name="Who else is using the XS Boards">Who else is using the XS Boards?</a></h2>
<p>Here is a <a href="/universities.php">list of some of the colleges and universities</a> 
that have purchased XS Boards.</p>

<h2><a name="How do we get up to speed on using the XS Boards">How do we get 
up to speed on using the XS Boards?</a></h2>
<p>We have a <a href="/appnotes/ise-10.php">tutorial for all the XSA Boards</a> that shows how to 
design and test several applications using the XILINX ISE WebPACK software.
In the near future, we will release a tutorial for the XuLA Board.
We also maintain an <a href="/design_examples.php">extensive list of design examples 
and tutorials</a> for our boards.</p>
<p>We also have an extensive <a href="/faq/faq_tech.php">FAQ</a> with helpful 
answers to questions from our customers.</p>
<p>In addition, we host an <a href="/forum.php">online forum</a> where our 
customers can exchange ideas and information.</p>
<p>For those using our older XS95 and XS40 Boards, XESS provides an online textbook
<a href="/prods/prod046.php">Pragmatic Logic Design With Foundation 2.1i</a>.&nbsp; 
The design files for these chapters are also available online.&nbsp; You can 
use them as-is or modify them to suit your needs.&nbsp; </p>

<h2><a name="Will the XS Boards stand up to the environment in our labs">Will 
the XS Boards stand up to the environment in our labs?</a></h2>
<p>The cumulative failure rate of the XS Boards over the past few years has 
been less than 0.5%.&nbsp; This includes boards used in introductory student 
logic labs, university research labs, and commercial development labs.</p>

<h2><a name="Will the XS Boards interface with our existing lab setup">Will 
the XS Boards interface with our existing lab setup?</a></h2>
<p>You can insert the XuLA and XSA Boards into your standard breadboards and wire them 
to the chips you already have to build even larger systems.  And all the XS Boards are 
programmed through a standard cable connected to the USB or parallel port of a PC.&nbsp; 
You can also reprogram the interfaces of the XSA and XSB Boards so they can 
be <span lang="en-us">used with</span> <span lang="en-us">the </span>X<span lang="en-us">ILINX</span> iMPACT 
<span lang="en-us">&nbsp;and ChipScope </span>software without the need to buy any special 
cables.  You can also use XILINX and third-party JTAG cables with the XuLA and XSA Boards.</p>

<h2><a name="Are the XS Boards expensive">Are the XS Boards expensive?</a></h2>
<p>No!&nbsp; The XS Boards provide a complete design environment for the price 
others charge for a simple evaluation board.&nbsp; Check our
<a href="/catalog.php">catalog</a> for a list of current prices.</p>
<p>Unlike other stripped-down evaluation boards that are little more than an 
FPGA on a circuit board, the XS Boards provide a complete environment that couples 
the FPGA with the RAM, Flash and I/O interfaces you need to do real development 
for your application.&nbsp; And our software utilities provide complete access 
to the features on our boards so you can not only configure the FPGA but also 
upload and download the RAM and Flash, program bitstreams into the Flash and more!&nbsp; 
Couple that with our world-class support and one-year warranty and you will see why tens of thousands 
have chosen to do their FPGA development on XS Boards.</p>

<h2><a name="Which XS Board is right for me">Which XS Board is right for me?</a></h2>
<p>We offer FPGA boards with a variety of options.&nbsp; Here are some factors 
to consider when choosing a board for your own use: </p>
<blockquote>
  <dl>
    <dt>Density:</dt>
    <dd>This is usually the first thing people think about: &quot;How many gates 
    do I get?&quot; Here are some statistics:</dd>
    <dd><center>
    <table class="striped">
    <thead>
      <tr>

    <tfoot>
        <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>
    </tfoot>
    </table>
    </center></dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt>Built-in RAM:</dt>
    <dd>If your designs need small internal RAMs for local storage, then the 
    Spartan3 and Spartan3A FPGAs on our XuLA and XSA Boards offer thousands 
    of 16x1 internal RAMs and dozens of 18K-bit BlockRAMs that are configurable 
    in widths from 1 to 32 bits.</dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt>External RAM:</dt>
    <dd>For external memory, the XuLA and XSA Boards offer from 8&nbsp;MB to 32&nbsp;MB 
    of synchronous DRAM, respectively.  The FPGA can use the external 
    RAM to store images or other data sets. We also offer a free
    <a href="/projects/sdramtst-1_6.zip">SDRAM interface design</a> that 
    hides the complexity of the timing and refresh and lets 
    you use the SDRAM as if it were a simple static RAM.</dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt>Non-volatile circuit configurations:</dt>
    <dd>The XuLA and XSA Boards both provide on-board Flash memory that can store 
    multiple configuration bitstreams for the FPGAs.&nbsp; The boards can be 
    placed in a mode where the FPGA is configured with the contents of the Flash 
    upon power-up.&nbsp; There is no need to buy serial PROMs and an external 
    programming device.&nbsp; On the XSA Board, the Flash device can also be read and/or written 
    by the FPGA after configuration.</dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt>JTAG support:</dt>
    <dd>You can use a XILINX or third-party JTAG cable to access the FPGAs on the XuLA and XSA Boards.</dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt>Power supplies:</dt>
    <dd>All the XS Boards have on-board regulators to generate the required 
    core and I/O voltages from a single power supply.</dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt>Design software and tutorials:</dt>
    <dd>You can develop applications for our XuLA and XSA Boards using the free
    XILINX ISE WebPACK software.</dd>
      <dd>
      <p>We have a <a href="/appnotes/ise-10.php">tutorial for the XSA Boards</a> that shows how to 
      design and test several applications using the XILINX ISE WebPACK software. 
  In the near future, we will release a tutorial for the XuLA Board.</p>

<h2><a name="Which platforms are supported">Which platforms are supported?</a></h2>
<p>We test our boards and the XSTOOLs utility software on PCs running Windows 7 and XP (both 32 and 64-bit versions). 
The XSTOOLs software that XESS supplies consists of downloading and testing programs that work through
the USB and parallel ports of the PC.
Any software that produces a XILINX-compatible downloading file (.BIT 
or .SVF) should work with our boards and utilities.</p>
<p>Currently the XSTOOLs utilities work on Windows machines. We provide full 
schematics in the <a href="/manuals.php">manual for each board</a> and the
<a href="/open_source.php">source code for our downloading utilities</a> 
is available, so it should not be too difficult to port it to other operating 
systems like Linux.</p>

<h2><a name="Do you sell your products through distributors">Do you sell your 
products through distributors?</a></h2>
<p>
Yes, here is a <a href="../../distributors.php">list of our distributors</a>. 
You may also purchase directly from XESS.
</p>


<h1><a name="Discounts">Discounts</a></h1>

<h2><a name="Are any of your products discounted">Are any of your products discounted?</a></h2>
<p>
We try to position our products at prices that would be considered 
reasonable by all our customers - engineers, hobbyists, academics and students. 
Our uniform pricing policy lets you know that the price you pay is no better 
or worse than the price anyone else pays.
</p>
<p>
That said, from time to time we will offer promotional pricing on some products.
So keep watch for those!
</p>


<h1><a name="Product Shipping and Delivery">Product Shipping and Delivery</a></h1>

<h2><a name="When will you fulfill a completed order">When will you ship 
a completed order?</a></h2>
<p>
Most orders received before 2:00 PM EST will be shipped that day. Shipment 
of orders with items that are not currently in-stock will be delayed until all 
items are ready for shipment.
</p>

<h2><a name="Do you ship to international addresses">Do you ship to international 
addresses?</a></h2>
<p>
Yes, we have shipped to many countries all over the world. 
Many of our international shipments are made by UPS and are shipped DDU (INCOTERMS, 2000), 
so you are also responsible for paying any and all import duties imposed 
by the customs regulations of your country. The harmonized tariff system 
code for our FPGA board products is 8473.30.91.00.
</p>
<p>
For lower shipping costs, consider using delivery through the postal system.
Although we can't track orders sent this way, it can cost as little as a couple of dollars -
perfect for those small orders where UPS is too much!
</p>

<h2><a name="What is your shipping fee">What is your shipping fee?</a></h2>
<p>
Our shipping fees vary according to the shipping method, number of items 
and their final destination. Your shipping fees will be shown on the order 
review page before the order is finally submitted, so you will have a chance 
to review them at that time.
</p>
<p>
Orders sent using UPS can be tracked, but the shipping charges are typically much
higher than using the postal system (especially for international orders).
On the other hand, most postal orders cannot be tracked, but First-Class postage 
can be as little as a few dollars to almost any country in the world.
</p>

<h2><a name="Can I track my order after it's shipped">Can I track my order after 
it's shipped?</a></h2>
<p>
Yes, if you choose to ship using UPS. If you supply your email address 
with your order (this is always a good thing to do), then we will send you an 
acknowledgement email when your order enters our system and when it is shipped. 
These emails will contain a link to the order tracking page on the UPS website 
so you can always check the location of your shipment.
</p>
<p>
We do not offer tracking on orders sent through the postal system.

<p>
You have thirty days after receipt of any XESS products to return them and 
get a refund or replacement, no questions asked.  (Sorry, we can't refund 
any shipping fees.)

<h2><a name="What is the guarantee on the XS Boards">What is the guarantee on 
XS Board products?</a></h2>
<p>
We inspect each board before shipping so they should arrive in good working 
order. You have thirty days after receipt of the boards to return them and get 
a refund or replacement, no questions asked.  We also warrant the boards 
for a year of normal use. (It is difficult to judge as to whether board 
failures are the result of abuse or not, so we have to work on a case by case 
basis.)

<h2><a name="What is your privacy policy">What is your privacy policy?</a></h2>
<p>
We maintain an internal list of all our customers in an off-line database. 
We use this database for billing purposes, to track customer problems, determine 
warranty expirations, to make offers to existing customers, etc. This 
database is a company asset that would transfer if XESS were ever sold to another 
company.</p>
<p>We do not provide any customer information to companies that are unrelated 
to our products. We do make some customer information available to companies 
that partner with us in order to bring inexpensive prototyping boards to our 
customers. In exchange for lower component prices or development software, 
these companies receive information on the customers who purchased products 
containing their components or software.</p>
